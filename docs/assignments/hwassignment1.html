<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Look at exercise 1.2.9, which describes an algorithm for finding the smallest distance between any two elements in an array.
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Describe in plain English why the algorithm is correct.</li>
<li>There are at least two improvements we can make to improve this algorithm. What are they? Can you think of more improvements?</li>
<li>Can you think of possibly a different approach to this problem?</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Look at exercise 1.3.1, which describes a sorting algorithm by performing “comparison counting”, i.e. for each element counting the number of elements that are less than it, and using this information to sort the elements.
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Apply the algorithm to sort the list <span class="math inline">\(60\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(35\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(81\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(98\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(14\)</span>. Show clearly the steps you follow, and make sure to follow the specific algorithm and not some other sorting method.</li>
<li>Is this a stable sorting algorithm? Is it an in-place sorting algorithm? Explain.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Exercise 2.2.1: Using the appropriate notation, indicate the time efficiency <em>class</em> of sequential search in the worst case, the best case and the average case.</li>
</ol>
