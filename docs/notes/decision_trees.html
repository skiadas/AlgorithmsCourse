<h1 id="decision-trees">Decision Trees</h1>
<ul>
<li>Read section 11.2 (pages 394-399)</li>
<li>What is the <strong>decision tree</strong> for an algorithm?</li>
<li>What can we say about the number of leafs for such a decision tree?</li>
<li>What is the relation that must hold between the number of leaves in a tree and the height of the tree?
<ul>
<li>What is the importance of the relation in terms of a lower bound for the corresponding algorithm?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>For the problem of sorting an array of values:
<ul>
<li>In terms of thinking of a decision tree for such an algorithm, the possible outcomes are all permutations of the array elements. How many such permutations are there?</li>
<li><p>A formula due to Stirling (page 477) gives us an estimate for <span class="math inline">\(n!\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[n! \sim \sqrt{2\pi n}\left(\frac{n}{e}\right)^n\]</span></p>
How does that relate to the lower estimate for the number of comparisons any sorting algorithm must perform?</li>
<li>Is the resulting lower bound a tight bound?</li>
<li>How can we find the average-case efficiency of a comparison-based algorithm using the decision tree?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>For the problem of searching for a key in a sorted array:
<ul>
<li>How does the decision tree for this problem differ from the previous one?</li>
<li>At least how many different leaves must such a decision tree have?</li>
<li>Can this tree ever be a full tree?</li>
<li>Why is it reasonable to incorporate the equals case into the node itself rather than a child-node? What do the leaves of this new tree represent?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Practice problems: 11.2.2, 11.2.3, 11.2.4, 11.2.5</li>
</ul>
