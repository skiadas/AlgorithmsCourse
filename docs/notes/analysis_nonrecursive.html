<h1 id="analysis-of-nonrecursive-algorithms">Analysis of Nonrecursive algorithms</h1>
<ul>
<li>Read 2.3, pages 61-66
<ul>
<li>Consider the algorithm described in Example 1, for finding the largest element in a list of n numbers.
<ul>
<li>Apart from the array, what other information does the algorithm need to store in memory, i.e. how much more memory does it need to use?</li>
<li>Explain what the “basic operation” is in this case, and how we arrived at that conclusion.</li>
<li></li>
<li>Explain how we count how many basic operations are needed in this algorithm. What is the algorithm’s time efficiency class?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Describe the five steps of the general plan for analyzing the time efficiency of a non-recursive algorithm, and identify those steps in the earlier example.</li>
<li>Review Appendix A (pages 475-577). You do not need to memorize those formulas, but you should familiarize yourself with them and make sure you understand what each says.</li>
<li>Study the algorithm described in Example 2, for determining if an array of elements contains two equal elements.
<ul>
<li>In what substantial way does this example differ from the first example?</li>
<li>Explain how the loop index limits make sense.</li>
<li>Explain what the “basic operation” is in this case.</li>
<li>Do we need to distinguish between worst-case, best-case and average-case in this instance? Why, or why not?</li>
<li>Follow the math steps at the top of page 64. Compare the steps used with formulas from the appendix.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Using appendix A where needed, answer the exercises:
<ul>
<li>2.3.1a, 2.3.1b, 2.3.1d, 2.3.2a, 2.3.4</li>
</ul></li>
