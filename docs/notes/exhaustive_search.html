<h1 id="exhaustive-search">Exhaustive Search</h1>
<ul>
<li>Read 3.4, pages 115-120
<ul>
<li>Describe the <strong>Traveling Salesman problem</strong> in terms of a graph.</li>
<li>What would the exhaustive-search approach to the TSP entail?</li>
<li>What shortcuts could we try to take to the exhaustive-search approach to the TSP?</li>
<li>Explain the figure for the number <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{2}(n-1)!\)</span> for the number of possible permutations we need to consider for TSP.</li>
<li>If <span class="math inline">\(n=20\)</span>, then this formula results in <span class="math inline">\(6.08\times 10^{16}\)</span> different permutations. If we can check 10 billion (<span class="math inline">\(1\times 10^{9}\)</span>) permutations per second, how many days would it take to go through all of them?</li>
<li>Describe what the <strong>knapsack problem</strong> is.</li>
<li>What would an exhaustive-search approach to the knapsack problem entail?</li>
<li>Why can’t we simply try to solve the knapsack problem by with an algorithm like: “Start with the largest-value item that fits in the knapsack, put that in, then continue with the largest-value item that fits in the remaining space, and so on”?</li>
<li>Describe the <strong>assignment problem</strong>.</li>
<li>How can we relate the assignment problem to permutations?</li>
<li>Consider the following problem: Peter has 8 hours of work available. He has a number of different projects he can work on. Each would take him a certain amount of time and also provide him with a certain reward. His goal is to maximize his reward. Does this problem fit into one of the three kinds of problems we saw in this section?</li>
<li>Consider exercise 3.4.6, describing the partition problem. Describe an exhaustive-search approach, and any optimizations that you can perform for it (if we keep in mind the symmetry in the two sides of an answer).</li>
</ul></li>
