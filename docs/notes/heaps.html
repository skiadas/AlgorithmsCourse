<h1 id="heaps">Heaps</h1>
<ul>
<li>Read section 6.4 (pages 226-232)</li>
<li>What are the three main operations of a <strong>priority queue</strong>?</li>
<li>What are the two properties that a <strong>heap</strong> has? How do heaps differ from binary search trees?
<ul>
<li>What are the differences between “max-heaps” and “min-heaps”?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>We consider heaps as arrays with values starting at index 1. How do the indices in the array correspond to the tree structure of the heap?
<ul>
<li>How can we write the <em>shape property</em> in terms of the array entries?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Study the <strong>bottom-up heap construction</strong> algorithm and figure 6.11.
<ul>
<li>Why is it important that the for loop move in the reverse direction?</li>
<li>Why does the for loop start from the middle of the array?</li>
<li>Each step of the for loop is often also called a “percolate down” operation. Explain why that is.</li>
<li>What is the role of the while loop? why is there not a single step for each i?</li>
<li>Roughly how many comparisons does the bottom-up construction require?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>How does the <strong>top-down heap construction</strong> algorithm work?
<ul>
<li>The key step in this algorithm is a “bubble up” operation. Explain why that is.</li>
<li>Make sure you understand how this algorithm differs from the bottom-up approach.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>How do we <strong>delete</strong> a key (in particular the maximum key) from the list?</li>
<li>How does <strong>heapsort</strong> work? What is its time efficiency?
<ul>
<li>What type of transform-and-conquer does heapsort represent?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Implement the heapsort algorithm to sort the letters of the word EXAMPLE.</li>
<li>Practice problems: 6.4.1, 6.4.2, 6.4.3, 6.4.5, 6.4.6</li>
