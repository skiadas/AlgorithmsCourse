<h1 id="p-np-np-complete-problems">P, NP, NP-Complete problems</h1>
<ul>
<li>Read section 11.3 (pages 401-409)</li>
<li>When do we call a problem <strong>tractable</strong>?</li>
<li>What are some problems that are tractable? What are some problems that are intractable?</li>
<li>What are <strong>decision problems</strong>? How do we represent the class of all tractable decision problems?</li>
<li>Are the following problems in P or not?
<ul>
<li>Given a graph, determine if the graph is complete.</li>
<li>Given a graph, determine if the graph has any triangles in it.</li>
<li>Given a graph, determine if we can assign a given number of colors to the vertices so that adjacent vertices have different colors.</li>
<li>The traveling salesman problem phrased as a decision problem: Given the city distances and an overall goal C, determine if you can travel through all the cities without ever visiting a city twice except at the end, so that you donâ€™t travel a total distance more than C.</li>
<li>The Knapsack problem as a decision problem: Given a list of items with values and weights, a knapsack with a given weight limit W and a target value goal V, determine if you can find a set of items that do not exceed the weight limit W but do reach the target value V.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>We represent by NP the class of all decision problems that are polynomial-time-verifiable. (this differs from the book definition but is equivalent). Which of the above problems are NP?</li>
<li>Open question in Computer Science: Is P = NP?</li>
<li>When do we say that a problem is <strong>polynomially reducible</strong> to another problem?
<ul>
<li>Explain how we can polynomially reduce the problem of finding a Hamiltonian path to that of solving the traveling salesman problem.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>When is a decision problem called <strong>NP-complete</strong>?
<ul>
<li>If a problem <span class="math inline">\(D_1\)</span> is NP-complete, and it can be polynomially reduced to a problem <span class="math inline">\(D_2\)</span>, then that problem is also NP-complete.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Practice problems: 11.3.2, 11.3.4, 11.3.5, 11.3.8, 11.3.9</li>
</ul>
