<h1 id="introduction-to-algorithms">Introduction to Algorithms</h1>
<h2 id="reading">Reading</h2>
<ul>
<li>Read 1.1, pages 3-7
<ul>
<li>What is an <strong>algorithm</strong>? Be very clear about the key points that would constitute an algorithm. Give examples of solutions to a problem that would NOT be considered algorithms.</li>
<li>What is an essential requirement for every step of an algorithm?</li>
<li>Is it possible for a problem to have many algorithms for its solution?</li>
<li>List the steps of Euclid’s algorithm for computing the greatest common divisor of two numbers. Also write the algorithm in pseudocode.
<ul>
<li>What happens to Euclid’s algorithm when the first number is smaller than the second?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Two key ways of describing an algorithm is via a sequence of steps and via pseudocode. Describe each way and the advantages and disadvantages.</li>
<li>Describe the <em>sieve of Eratosthenes</em> algorithm for finding a list of prime numbers.</li>
<li>Challenges (optional): Exercises 1.1.11, 1.1.12.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Read 1.2, pages 9-16
<ul>
<li>Correct the order of the following steps that are needed when trying to find an algorithmic solution to a problem, and add any other needed steps:
<ul>
<li>Understand the computational means of our system</li>
<li>Choose a strategy for the algorithm</li>
<li>Clearly define what the inputs and outputs in an instance of the problem are</li>
<li>Try some simple cases</li>
<li>Write code for the algorithm</li>
<li>Prove that the algorithm is correct</li>
<li>Specify the algorithm via pseudocode or a flowchart</li>
<li>Analyze various aspects of the algorithm like efficiency, simplicity, generality</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What are the two kinds of efficiencies that we look at regarding an algorithm?</li>
<li>What are the differences between sequential and parallel algorithms?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Read 1.3, pages 19-23
<ul>
<li>What do we refer to as a <strong>sorting problem</strong>?</li>
<li>Give at least 3 examples of sorting from real life (i.e. situations where values are presented in an increasing or decreasing order based on some key, and where this ordering presents some advantage).</li>
<li>When is a sorting algorithm called <strong>stable</strong>? Be precise.
<ul>
<li>What is the advantage of stable sorting algorithms</li>
</ul></li>
<li>When is a sorting algorithm called <strong>in-place</strong>?</li>
<li>What are other important classes of problems?</li>
<li>Work on exercise 1.3.8</li>
<li>Challenge: 1.3.9</li>
</ul></li>
