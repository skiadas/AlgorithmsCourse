<h1 id="brute-force-algorithms">Brute-Force algorithms</h1>
<ul>
<li>Read 3.1, pages 97-101
<ul>
<li>What is the main idea behind the “brute force” approach?</li>
<li>The book lists at least four possible reasons why a brute-force solution to a problem might be desirable. What are they?</li>
<li>You can see visualizations of the various sorting algorithms on this site: <a href="https://visualgo.net" class="uri">https://visualgo.net</a>. I strongly encourage you to play around with it, and visually see the three sorting algorithms we have seen so far (Counting, Selection, Bubble).</li>
<li>Study the <strong>SelectionSort</strong> algorithm.
<ul>
<li>What is the main idea of the SelectionSort algorithm?</li>
<li>Explain the use of the double-for loop, and in particular the indices for each loop.</li>
<li>What does the variable <code>min</code> represent in the loop? Be precise.</li>
<li>At intermediate steps of the algorithm, what part of the array, if any, is sorted?</li>
<li>Study Figure 3.1 which shows a run of the algorithm. What is the meaning of the vertical lines?</li>
<li>Is SelectionSort an in-place algorithm? Is it a stable algorithm?</li>
<li>Analyze the time complexity of SelectionSort.</li>
<li>Is there a difference in SelectionSort between best-case and worst-case?</li>
<li>How many entry swaps are needed for SelectionSort?
<ul>
<li>Why might we care about this?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The pseudocode is presented assuming the list of numbers is stored as an array. Do you think the algorithm could work if the numbers were stored as a linked list? What would need to change?</li>
<li>Practice problems: 3.1.8, 3.1.10</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Study the <strong>BubbleSort</strong> algorithm.
<ul>
<li>What is the main idea of BubbleSort? Why is it called that?</li>
<li>Explain the use of the double-for loop, and in particular the indices for each loop, especially the inner loop.</li>
<li>At intermediate steps of the algorithm, what part of the array, if any, is sorted?</li>
<li>Study Figure 3.2 which shows a run of the algorithm. What is the meaning of the vertical lines?</li>
<li>Is BubbleSort an in-place algorithm? Is it a stable algorithm?</li>
<li>Analyze the time complexity of BubbleSort.</li>
<li>Is there a difference in BubbleSort between best-case and worst-case?</li>
<li>How many entry swaps are needed for BubbleSort?</li>
<li>Practice problems: 3.1.11, 3.1.14</li>
</ul></li>
