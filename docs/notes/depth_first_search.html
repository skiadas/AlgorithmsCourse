<h1 id="depth-first-search">Depth-first search</h1>
<ul>
<li>Read 3.5, pages 122-125
<ul>
<li>Describe the basic idea of the depth-first search approach to traversing the vertices of a graph.</li>
<li>When does a vertex become <strong>visited</strong>? When does it become a <strong>dead-end</strong>?</li>
<li>Explain why one might want to use a <em>stack</em> to keep track of the vertices as they are being visited.</li>
<li>The presence of the stack suggests two kinds of orders to the vertices, visually shown in part b of Figure 3.10. Explain what those two orders are.
<ul>
<li>Explain which of these orders the <code>count</code> variable in the algorithm tracks.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Looking at the graph of Exercise 3.5.1, carry out the DFS process following the alphabetical ordering of the edges.</li>
<li>What graph do we refer to as the <strong>depth-first search forest</strong> of a DFS search?</li>
<li>What edges of the original graph do we refer to as <strong>tree edges</strong> and which do we refer to as <strong>back edges</strong>?</li>
<li>Carry out the construction of the depth-first search forest for the graph from exercise 3.5.1.</li>
<li>Repeat the process for the same graph but now using reverse alphabetical ordering (so <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> is the vertex that is visited first).</li>
<li>Is the algorithm in the book about DFS recursive or non-recursive?</li>
<li>True or False: When starting from a root vertex, all vertices within the same connected component as that vertex will be visited within that iteration and no other vertices will be visited (unless we restart from a new vertex).</li>
<li>True or False: The original graph has a cycle if and only if we end up having “back edges”.</li>
<li>Explain the run-time efficiency of <span class="math inline">\(\Theta(|V|+|E|)\)</span> for the DFS algorithm (Hint: How many times are each vertex and each edge visited?).</li>
</ul></li>
