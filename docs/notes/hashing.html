<h1 id="hashing">Hashing</h1>
<ul>
<li>Read section 7.3 (pages 269-275)</li>
<li>What abstract data type are <strong>hash tables</strong> used for? What operations does that type support?</li>
<li>What do we call the <strong>hash function</strong>? What is the <strong>hash address</strong> of a key?</li>
<li>If our keys are characters, and we want to store them in a hash table of size <span class="math inline">\(m=10\)</span>, based on a hash function that counts the letters from 0 and then computes that number modulo <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>. What hash addresses would the letters in EXAMPLE correspond to?</li>
<li>What are some important properties of a <em>good</em> hash function?</li>
<li>What do we call a <strong>collision</strong> in a hash table?</li>
<li>How does the <strong>open hashing</strong>, or <strong>separate chaining</strong> mechanism store keys?
<ul>
<li>How do we perform search/insertion/deletion in the open hashing case?</li>
<li>What factors influence the length of the resulting linked lists?</li>
<li>What number is the <strong>load factor</strong> of a hash table?</li>
<li>If we want to store 100 keys in a hash table of size 20, what is the load factor?</li>
<li>In a hash table with load factor <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>, how many elements need to be inspected on average, for a successful search? What about unsuccessful searches?</li>
<li>What consequence does having a large load factor (much less than 1) have?</li>
<li>What consequence does having a small load factor (much more than 1) have?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In what way is the hash table a space-time trade-off?</li>
<li>How does the <strong>closed hashing</strong>, or <strong>open addressing</strong> mechanism store keys?
<ul>
<li>What load factors can we have in this scheme?</li>
<li>How does <strong>linear probing</strong> resolve resolutions?</li>
<li>How does search work in this scheme? What about deletion?</li>
<li>What are <strong>clusters</strong> and why do they cause problems for closed hashing?</li>
<li>What is the average access time for closed hashing in terms of the load factor <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>, for both successful and unsuccessful searches?</li>
<li>What values of the load factor should we aim for in closed hashing?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Practice problems: 7.3.1, 7.3.2, 7.3.3, 7.3.5, 7.3.7</li>
