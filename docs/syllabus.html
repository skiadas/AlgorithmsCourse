<h2 id="course-components">Course Components</h2>
<h3 id="reading-notes">Reading Notes</h3>
<p>On the website you will find a <a href="http://skiadas.github.io/AlgorithmsCourse/site/schedule.html">schedule</a> with links to documents for each class day. In those documents you will find notes for the day’s lesson, and reading assignments.</p>
<h3 id="class-attendance-and-participation">Class Attendance and Participation</h3>
<p>You are expected to attend every class meeting. You are only allowed to miss 3 classes without excuse, and every absence beyond that will result in 1 percentage point removed from your final grade. There are very few reasons that would qualify as an excuse for an absence. During each class day you will be working on and submitting activity sheets, which will be scored as your class participation grade.</p>
<h3 id="homework-assignments">Homework Assignments</h3>
<p>There will be regular homework assignments about once a week. These assignments will expect you to answer theoretical questions and/or design algorithms for certain problems. Homework assignments are 10% of your final grade.</p>
<h3 id="programming-assignments">Programming Assignments</h3>
<p>There will be regular programming assignments about once every two weeks. The assignments are there to help you practice your understanding of some of the concepts, as well as to give you some familiarity with programming in Java. Programming assignments are 20% of your final grade.</p>
<h3 id="exams">Exams</h3>
<p>There will be two midterms, tentatively scheduled for Friday, February 9th and Friday, March 16, and a final during finals week. <strong>You have to be here for the exams</strong>. If you have conflicts with these days, let me know as soon as possible. Do not plan your vacation before you are aware of the finals schedule.</p>
<h3 id="getting-help">Getting Help</h3>
<ul>
<li>You should never hesitate to ask me questions. I will never think any less of anyone for asking a question. Stop by my office hours or just email me your question, which has the great benefit of forcing you to write it down in clear terms, which often helps you understand it better.</li>
<li>You are allowed, and in fact encouraged, to work together and help each other regarding the notes and the theory. You can also discuss general questions about the programming assignments and the homework assignments. But I expect you to work on the programming assignments and the homework assignments on your own.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="grading">Grading</h2>
<p>Your final grade depends on class attendance, homework, project, quizzes, midterms and the final, as follows:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th align="right">Component</th>
<th align="right">Percent</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="right">Participation</td>
<td align="right">10%</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="right">Homework</td>
<td align="right">10%</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="right">Programming</td>
<td align="right">20%</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="right">Worst Midterm</td>
<td align="right">15%</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="right">Middle Midterm</td>
<td align="right">20%</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="right">Best Midterm</td>
<td align="right">25%</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>This gives a number up to 100, which is then converted to a letter grade based roughly on the following correspondence:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th align="center">Letter grade</th>
<th align="right">Percentage Range</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="center">A, A-</td>
<td align="right">90%-100%</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="center">B+, B, B-</td>
<td align="right">80%-90%</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="center">C+, C, C-</td>
<td align="right">70%-80%</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="center">D+, D, D-</td>
<td align="right">60%-70%</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="center">F</td>
<td align="right">0%-60%</td>
