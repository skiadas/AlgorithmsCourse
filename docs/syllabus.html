<h2 id="course-description">Course Description</h2>
<p>TODO</p>
<h2 id="course-components">Course Components</h2>
<h3 id="reading-notes">Reading Notes</h3>
<p>On the website you will find a <a href="http://skiadas.github.io/AlgorithmsCourse/site/schedule.html">schedule</a> with links to documents for each class day. In those documents you will find notes for the dayâ€™s lesson, and reading assignments.</p>
<h3 id="class-attendance">Class Attendance</h3>
<p>You are expected to attend every class meeting. You are only allowed to miss 3 classes without excuse. From that point on, every unexcused absence will result in a reduction of your final score by one percentage point, up to a total of 5 points. Excused absences should be arranged in advance, and backed by appropriate documentation. Emergencies will be dealt with on an individual basis. There are very few reasons that would qualify as an excuse for an absence.</p>
<h3 id="programming-assignments">Programming Assignments</h3>
<p>There will be regular programming assignments about once every two weeks. The assignments are there to help you practice your understanding of new concepts, as well as to prepare you for the major project. Programming assignments are 30% of your final grade.</p>
<h3 id="exams">Exams</h3>
<p>TODO</p>
<p>There will be two midterms, tentatively scheduled for Friday, October 13th and a final during finals week. <strong>You have to be here for the exams</strong>. If you have conflicts with these days, let me know as soon as possible. Do not plan your vacation before you are aware of the finals schedule.</p>
<h3 id="getting-help">Getting Help</h3>
<ul>
<li>You should never hesitate to ask me questions. I will never think any less of anyone for asking a question. Stop by my office hours or just email me your question, which has the great benefit of forcing you to write it down in clear terms, which often helps you understand it better.</li>
<li>You are allowed, and in fact encouraged, to work together and help each other regarding the notes and the the theory. You can also discuss general questions about the programming assignments. But I expect you to work on the programming assignments on your own.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="grading">Grading</h2>
<p>Your final grade depends on class attendance, homework, project, quizzes, midterms and the final, as follows:</p>
<p>TODO</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th align="right">Component</th>
<th align="right">Percent</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="right">Attendance</td>
<td align="right">5%</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="right">Assignments</td>
<td align="right">30%</td>

<tr class="odd">
<td align="right">Project</td>

<td align="right">15%</td>

<tr class="odd">
<td align="right">Final</td>
<td align="right">15%</td>

</table>
<p>This gives a number up to 100, which is then converted to a letter grade based roughly on the following correspondence:</p>
<table>

<tr class="header">

<tr class="odd">
