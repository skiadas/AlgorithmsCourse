# Greedy Algorithms: Dijkstra's Algorithm

- Read section 9.3 (pages 333-337)
- What problem does **Dijkstra's algorithm**?
    - What information does it need to maintain?
    - How does it update this information?
    - What other data structure is needed in Dijkstra's algorithm?
- Describe how Dijkstra's algorithm operates.
- In what sense is Dijkstra's algorithm a greedy algorithm?
- Write pseudocode for Dijkstra's algorithm.
- Why is it important for Dijkstra's algorithm that all edge weights are non-negative?
- Possibly: Talk about Fibonacci heaps
- Practice problems: 9.3.1, 9.3.2, 9.3.3, 9.3.4
