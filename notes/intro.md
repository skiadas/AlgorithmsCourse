# Introduction to Algorithms

## Reading

- Read 1.1, pages 3-7
    - What is an **algorithm**? Be very clear about the key points that would constitute an algorithm. Give examples of solutions to a problem that would NOT be considered algorithms.
    - What is an essential requirement for every step of an algorithm?
    - Is it possible for a problem to have many algorithms for its solution?
    - List the steps of Euclid's algorithm for computing the greatest common divisor of two numbers. Also write the algorithm in pseudocode.
        - What happens to Euclid's algorithm when the first number is smaller than the second?
    - Two key ways of describing an algorithm is via a sequence of steps and via pseudocode. Describe each way and the advantages and disadvantages.
    - Describe the *sieve of Eratosthenes* algorithm for finding a list of prime numbers.
    - Challenges (optional): Exercises 1.1.11, 1.1.12.
- Read 1.2, pages 9-16
    - Correct the order of the following steps that are needed when trying to find an algorithmic solution to a problem, and add any other needed steps:
        - Understand the computational means of our system
        - Choose a strategy for the algorithm
        - Clearly define what the inputs and outputs in an instance of the problem are
        - Try some simple cases
        - Write code for the algorithm
        - Prove that the algorithm is correct
        - Specify the algorithm via pseudocode or a flowchart
        - Analyze various aspects of the algorithm like efficiency, simplicity, generality
    - What are the two kinds of efficiencies that we look at regarding an algorithm?
    - What are the differences between sequential and parallel algorithms?
- Read 1.3, pages 19-23
    - What do we refer to as a **sorting problem**?
    - Give at least 3 examples of sorting from real life (i.e. situations where values are presented in an increasing or decreasing order based on some key, and where this ordering presents some advantage).
    - When is a sorting algorithm called **stable**? Be precise.
        - What is the advantage of stable sorting algorithms
    - When is a sorting algorithm called **in-place**?
    - What are other important classes of problems?
    - Work on exercise 1.3.8
    - Challenge: 1.3.9
