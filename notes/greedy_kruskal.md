# Greedy Algorithms: Kruskal's Algorithm

- Read section 9.2 (pages 325-333)
- How does **Kruskal's algorithm** grow the minimum spanning tree? How does that differ from Prim's?
    - Would Kruskal's be classified as a greedy algorithm? why?
    - What does the `ecounter` variable do?
    - What are the difficult parts of Kruskal's algorithm?
    - Does the start vertex for the algorithm affect the order in which edges are chosen?
- What is the **union-find** structure? What operations does it allow?
    - What are the operations that Kruskal's algorithm needs from such a structure?
    - Show how the structure can be used in the context of Kruskal's algorithm.
    - What are the two main alternatives of the union-find structure?
- Practice problems: 9.2.1, 9.2.2, 9.2.12
