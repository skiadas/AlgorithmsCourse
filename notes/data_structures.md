    - What is a **priority queue**? What are its key operations?
    - What are the two ways of representing **graphs**? What are the advantages and disadvantages of each approach?
    - How can we represent **weighted graphs**?
    - When do we say that a graph is **connected**?
    - What graphs do we call **(free) trees**?
    - What is the difference between a "free tree", a "rooted tree" and an "ordered tree"?
    - What are **binary search trees**?
    - Describe the **first child-next sibling** representation of ordered trees. Illustrate with an example of an ordered tree presented both "normally" and via this alternative representation.
    - Work on exercises 1.4.2, 1.4.3, 1.4.4
